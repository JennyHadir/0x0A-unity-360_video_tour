# 360 video tour
Starting with this project, you will begin creating VR experiences. This will require you to have a VR headset to test your projects. There are Oculus Go headsets to work with at the Holberton San Francisco location. If you cannot come on site or if you do not have your own headset, an inexpensive option is Google Cardboard.

Depending on your headset, there are different considerations you will need to take into account when developing your VR projects, such as which SDK to use, control / navigation schemes, hardware capabilities, etc. As headsets and SDKs vary, this and future VR projects will not contain specific instructions on how to accomplish the tasks – you will be expected to utilize the Framework and the documentation and tutorials relevant to your hardware.

## Learning objectives
* At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is 3DOF vs 6DOF
* What VR headsets are on the current market and how to target them
* What is 360 video and what are its potential use cases
* What is the difference between monoscopic and stereoscopic 360 video
* What are render textures
* How to use Unity’s Video Player component

## Requirements for Unity projects
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your 0x0A-unity-360_video_tour directory
* This project should be uploaded to its own repo named 0x0A-unity-360_video_tour
* Scenes and project assets such as Scripts must be organized as described in the tasks
* In your scripts, all your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* In your scripts, all your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
